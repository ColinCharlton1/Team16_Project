# Team16_Project
CPSC 219 group project for team 16

to run demo2 only use only the folder labeled demo2 update, still figuring out how to use github properly for updates.
To run this program, compile code and then run the Class Display.java

updates for demo 2:
- added comments and organized
- changed to a new map generation method
- reorganized to create some child and parent classes (MapNode & PathNode)
- added in graphics
